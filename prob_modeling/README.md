#### Probabilistic Model Checking (Section 5)


Each sub-directory contains a demonstration of the respective b-program evaluation for a given parameter range, in addition to the scripts used during the experiments (named modeling or sampling).
Running the demos performs the sampling followed by model translation and verification.

##### Monty Hall

The code for the Monty Hall experiment is located in the `monty_hall` directory. 
The demo must be run from within that directory.

`demo.py` accepts the following parameters:
* `min` - the minimum number of doors
* `max` - the maximum number of doors
* `--samples` - the number of samples taken

For example, running the Monty Hall demo on a minimum of 3 and maximum of 4 doors, taking 10000 samples:
```shell
python3 demo.py 3 4 --samples 10000
```

The script outputs the sampling results to different csv files in the `samples` subdirectory.
For instance, the results of the above command reproduce the ones shown in Figure 5(a), 
and are saved to `samples/sample_3d1p1o.csv`.

This command also produces the results for the analysis shown in Table 4 (albeit with different parameters), 
which are saved to `translation_overview.csv`.  
Larger parameters inputs, as shown in the same table, may take multiple days and require additional resources.
Note that since the demo script does not timeout, a scaled down evaluation can instead be achieved via the demo by running the following command (**this can take few minutes**):

```shell
python3 demo.py 7 7 --samples 10000
```

##### Dice Problem

The code for the dice problem experiment is located in the `dice_problem` directory. 
The demo must be run from within that directory.

`demo.py` accepts the following parameters:
* `min` - the minimum number of dice sides
* `max` - the maximum number of dice sides
* `--samples` - the number of samples taken

For example, running the experiment on a minimum of 6 and maximum of 30 sides, taking 10000 samples for each parameter: 
```shell
python3 demo.py 6 30 --samples 10000
```

As in the monty hall experiment,
the script outputs sampling results to different csv files in the `samples` subdirectory and translation evaluation to `translation_overview.csv`. Table 6 is the overview as generated by the example command.


##### Bitflip

The `demo.py` file runs only the sampling for the given parameters, and accepts the following:
* `n` - number of rows in the matrix
* `m` - number of columns in the matrix
* `--samples` - number of iterations to use for sampling

For example, running the experiment for a 3x3 matrix and 1000 samples:
```shell
python3 demo.py 3 3 --samples 1000
```

`sample_all.sh` reproduces a scaled down version of the comparison found in table 8, only generating 1000 samples and timing out after 6 minutes. It can be run by using

```shell
./sample_all.sh
```


##### Directory structure
The directories largely share the same structure and usage:

* `bprogram_name.py` - contains the b-program and respective parameter(s) generation
* `demo.py` - python program for performing the evaluation on parmeters within the given arguments range
* `sampling.py` - generates samples and statistics
* `modeling.py` - generates the b-program PRISM translation and respective propositions
* `run_computation.sh` - runs Storm on the translations + propositions within the models subdirectory
* `read_log.py` - processes the above's results into one table 

**Note the bitflip demo does not generate the translated models for exact analysis.**


|                  | **Parameter**      | **Min** | **Max** |
|------------------|--------------------|---------|---------|
| **Monty Hall**   | Total doors        | 3       | 10      |
| **Dice Problem** | Number of sides    | 6       | 35      |
| **Bitflip**      | Matrix  dimensions | 2,2     | 4,5     |
