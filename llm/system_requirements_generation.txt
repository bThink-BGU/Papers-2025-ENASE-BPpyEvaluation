Give an example of a list of requirements for an example of a discrete event system.
Additionally, provide a python Test class that will test the required system. The class will a specific test method for each requirement.
The example should include a list of 3-8 events and a list of 3-10 requirements that should relate to the events.
Don't require anything that relates to time frames or logging.

For instance:

Events: A, B, C
requirements:
1. A should happen 3 times.
2. If C occurs right after A than B must happen immediately.
3. there should be no consecutive As

Test class:
import unittest

class Test(unittest.TestCase):

    def __init__(self, trace, *args, **kwargs):
        super(Test, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.trace = trace
        self.tests_num = 4

    def req_1(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.trace.count('A'), 3)

    def req_2(self):
        for i in range(len(self.trace) - 1):
            if self.trace[i] == 'A' and self.trace[i + 1] == 'C':
                self.assertEqual(self.trace[i + 2], 'B')


    def req_3(self):
        for i in range(len(self.trace) - 1):
            if self.trace[i] == 'A':
                self.assertNotEqual(self.trace[i + 1], 'A')
