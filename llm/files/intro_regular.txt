Create a function that generates a list of events based on the following desired events and
requirements:

{requirements}

the list returned should be non-deterministic and should be able to generate a different list of
events each time it is called.
That is to represent a different run of the system each time. Additionally, the function should
terminate.

Please answer with the code only and without any additional text.
